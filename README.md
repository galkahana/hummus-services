Making it public: 26.5.2022. 
so 7 yrs ago (apparently) i figured that maybe i should try to make some $$$ on hummus. idea is simple - sas for pdf generation. use the service api to send a json and get back a pdf file (either a file, or link to download or public link to share). implemented all the backend and neat frontend (in angular 1)...even deployed the thing on the then fresh google cloud service. had cron jobs for autodelete, automated emails when somebody signs up. and when it got to making this a business i got scared and left it. guess on my own i'm only good for open source...and maybe even that not so much...cause i can't seem to find happiness in that.

anyways, i might pick it up again if only to convert it to react to brush up my frontend caps. it's been a bit since i wrote and i'm starting to forget stuff. plus i had this infra that i wanna try out on a proper site that gave react its deserving place as data<->display helper, and left biz logic to regular javascript classes/interfaces for better reuse (good old MVC...and screw all this reactiveness for when i dont need it).

and since i'm not doing anything with it, and there's some examples for how to do stuff that's possibly beneficial to others...and you know...never hurts to show your code for them headhunters (even 7 yrs old code...figured they still check out my hummus stuff which is 11 yrs old (omg), figured i'll make it public.

Enjoy!

p.s. depending on how much time i got (and not necessarily in line with public interest which will probably be nothing) i'll expand this readme with proper instructs. and maybe move this whole discussion to my blog...or finally start using what the kids these days like - medium. where i can tell about how i left my comfort zone or did something that i thought was otherwise awesome (omitting the later post admitting i was wrong)...etc.

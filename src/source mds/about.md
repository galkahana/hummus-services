# A cloud based PDF generation service

Good for any application that requires creation of PDF documents. A perfect match to any developer that doesn't want the hassle.      

Simple to use - Use REST, NodeJS or your client Javascript code to send a job description to PDFHummus Services. A PDF file will be created on our servers, and in return you'll get back a URL that you can download the file from.  

You can use this URL to either download this PDF to your server, or send it directly to your end customer through email.  

# It is your Choice for Generating PDF files 

1. The job description is a Javascript object. Simple to create programatically. Very easy to introduce variable data and create templates. 
2. The service API is good for any application, using a simple REST procotol. And we got some helper libs for NodeJS and Client Javascript. Since our servers do all the hard PDF crunching - you can easily introduce PDF creation to your lightweight apps, and even your wordpress sites.
3. Generation is fast thanks to a very efficient engine, so you can create the PDFs on demand.
4. PDF files are stored permanently on our servers (well, you can have them deleted them if you want to).
5. You pay as you go - according to how large the PDFs are, and how many times they are accessed.


# More ...

PDFHummus services is powered by [HummusJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hummus), A NodeJS open source module growing in popularity. In turn it is dependent on the [PDFHummus C++ library](https://github.com/galkahana/PDF-Writer) which has been around since 2011, serving many successful projects. 

PDFHummus services are developed by the same people (ok, Person, for now) that work on the open source projects, and we'll (I) will be looking to extend the services to include anything that the libraries can do - but in a much simpler declerative manner.
